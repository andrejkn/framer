**Framer** is consisted of movable frames which can be docked (minimized). Inside each movable frame there is a widget.
Widgets emulate desktop applications, but really they are just DOM nodes, such as a `textarea`, `iframe`, `ReactElement` etc.
Also, framer has a **DOCK** which is a pane, which is also movable,
that contains buttons of the active widgets. The dock is similar to the
*Start* menu from Windows or the *Dock* from MacOS.
