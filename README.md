# Framer
**Framer** is an app which enables DOM elements to be loaded in **moving** windows - *app frames*. Essentially we are trying to create a "desktop-like" environment which can manage multiple web apps in the browser.

Each window can be re-sized and moved.
Also, each window can be in the two states:

  1. visible
  2. minimized
